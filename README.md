<h2 align="center">â¤® My Coding Journey </h2>

Coding is tubular. Its applications are boundless in life, paving the way for expression, problem-solving, and innovation. There truly is something for everyone: beginner-friendly, sage-tier, fun-seekers, and all the in-betweens. Two events got me into coding: hackathons and the Odin project. The sheer knowledge and insights I got from hackathons were surprising. As for [the Odin project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject), it amazed me how many intricate details and tidbits Erik and his team were able to share with us *odinites*. Big up to them.
